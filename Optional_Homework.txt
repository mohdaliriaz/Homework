Entity Relationship Diagram : An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data. An entity set is a collection of similar entities. These entities can have attributes that define its properties.

Entity Data Model : The Entity Data Model (EDM) is an extended version of the Entity-Relationship model which specifies the conceptual model of the data using various modelling technique. It also refers to a set of concepts that describe data structure, regardless of its stored form.

Assymetric encryption : Asymmetric Encryption is a form of Encryption where keys come in pairs. What one key encrypts, only the other can decrypt.

Frequently, the keys are interchangeable, in the sense that if key A encrypts a message, then B can decrypt it, and if key B encrypts a message, then key A can decrypt it. While common, this property is not essential to asymmetric encryption.

Asymmetric Encryption is also known as Public Key Cryptography, since users typically create a matching key pair, and make one public while keeping the other secret.
