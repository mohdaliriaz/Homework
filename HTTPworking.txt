Headers: HTTP headers are the name or value pairs that are displayed in the request and response messages of message headers for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Usually, the header name and the value are separated by a single colon. HTTP headers are an integral part of HTTP requests and responses. In simpler terms, HTTP headers are the code that transfers data between a Web server and a browser. HTTP headers are mainly intended for the communication between the server and client in both directions.


Header Parameters: Header parameters are included in the request header. Usually, the header just includes authorization parameters that are common across all endpoints; as a result, the header parameters aren’t usually documented with each endpoint.However, if your endpoint requires unique parameters to be passed in the header, you would document them in the parameters documentation within each endpoint.


HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.
